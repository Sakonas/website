  Welcome to CodePen, Vaqcoders!
  <img width="35px" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/icons/471818830428241920/ce6c834c0e288df61a00de5fb1d1d8cc.png">

<h3>HTML</h3>
<p>This environment uses three languages to create a simulated webpage. What you are reading is written in HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language; 'Markup' because you <i>see what you write</i>. Please refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3Schools</a> for help regarding HTML.</p>

<h3>JS</h3>
<p>The most interesting and functional, however, is the third window, JS, standing for JavaScript. JavaScript is a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language">high-level</a> programming language mainly used on the web. If you are here to learn programming, you should focus on JavaScript out of these three languages. Please refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">MDN</a> for help regarding native JavaScript. If you wish to use a more simplified environment which exclusively focuses on JavaScript, please use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/new/pjs">Khan Academy</a> or the <a target="_blank" href="https://editor.p5js.org/">p5js Editor</a>.</p>

<h3>CSS</h3>
<p>The CSS window in the middle is for <i>style</i>. CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is the main utility used in webdesign and is primarily used to beautify webpages. Please refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">MDN</a> for help regarding CSS.</p>

<h3>Vaqcoders,</h3>
<p>So, I am aware that this all may seem scary or too ambitious of a task to take on. Learning to program takes a lot of self-teaching, failure, patience, practice, and frustration, but mainly, <i>self-integrity</i>. This can be compared to exercise, in that you cannot cheat yourself out of working out. If you are truly curious and excited about programming, you will succeed.</p>
<p>Anyways, I invite anyone to <i>fork</i> this pen, get rid of all the code you don't need and initialize a project of your own. This pen already has the <a target="_blank" href="https://p5js.org/reference/">p5.js library</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://api.jquery.com/">jQuery library</a> built in so that you can have access to drawing capabilities as found on Khan Academy. Also, always remember to save and take breaks here and there, get good grades this year, and have fun! Visit the <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/QjEEs7V">Vaqcoders Discord</a> if you have any questions or wanna chill.</p>
